baking choco lava cake

    Place the ramekins in a preheated oven and bake for 200 degrees celsius for 30 to 35 minutes. Preheat oven for 15 to 20 minutes at 200 degrees celsius before you start baking.

    Then gently invert the ramekins on a serving plate or tray. Be careful as the ramekins will be hot. 
    Tap the base of the ramekins and let the lava cake slid through and fall on the plate.
    Using a small sieve, dust some cocoa powder or powdered sugar on the choco lava cakes.
    Serve choco lava cake immediately.
